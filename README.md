# Kaggle Competitions

This repository contains solutions to the Kaggle competitions I attempted.

1) [Titanic]()

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is the like “Hello World” of machine learning and I also started ML from here. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers, we need to predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
