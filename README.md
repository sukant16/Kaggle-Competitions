# Kaggle Competitions

This repository contains solutions to the Kaggle competitions I attempted.

1) [Titanic](https://github.com/sukant16/Kaggle-Competitions/tree/master/Titanic)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is like the “Hello World” of machine learning and I also started my ML journey from here. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers, we need to predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
